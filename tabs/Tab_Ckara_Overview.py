    A data engineering project simulating a real-world business scenario for a specialty coffee brand operating in Spain. This project focuses on designing and implementing a multi-layered **data warehouse** to unify data across sales, employee activity, and marketing engagement.

    ---

    ## 📌 Objectives

    - Centralize disparate datasets into a unified, scalable **data warehouse**
    - Build **ETL pipelines** using **Alteryx** to automate data transformation
    - Support business KPIs across departments: Sales, Marketing, HR, and Operations
    - Enable actionable analytics like product demand by region, employee performance, and social media ROI

    ---

    ## 🏗️ Tech Stack

    - **ETL**: Alteryx
    - **Data Modeling**: Star Schema
    - **Database Design**: Fact and Dimension tables
    - **Scripting**: SQL (for DDL & analysis)
    - **BI Use Case**: Insights derived from DWH to support expansion and targeting strategy

    ---

    ## 🧱 Data Warehouse Structure

    This project implements a **multi-domain DWH** composed of the following:

    ### 🟦 Fact Tables
    - `SALES_FACT`: transactions, revenue, quantity, store
    - `CLICKS_FACT`: clickstream events, browser, duration
    - `EMPLOYEE_FACT`: employee performance, social media engagement

        ### 🟩 Dimension Tables
    - `DATE_DIM`: day, month, year
    - `BROWSER_DIM`: browser type, browser id
    - `EMPLOYEE_DIM`: name, employee id
    - `INSTA_CAPTIONS_DIM`: date updated, captions, hashtags
    - `INSTA_METRICS_DIM`: date updated, impressions, from home, from hashtags, from explore, from other, saves, comments, shares, likes, profile visits, follows
    - `NEIGHBOURHOODS_DIM`: neighbourhood id, neighbourhood
    - `PRODUCT_DIM`: product id, product group, product type, product, product description
    - `ONLINE_CLICKS_DIM`: neighbourhood id, click id, browser id, entry time, duration, attributes
    - `STORE_DIM`: store id, store location
    - `TRANSACTIONS_DIM`: date id, transaction id, transaction quantity, store id, product id, employee id

    ## 🧪 Key Use Cases

    - Identify high-performing products (e.g., 32% sales growth in Brazilian coffee)
    - Detect underserved areas like **El Born** with high demand for "Instagrammable" coffee shops
    - Correlate employee social media activity with store performance
    - Optimize new store locations using combined sales + clickstream data

    ---

    ## 📊 Sample Query

    ```sql
    -- Total sales by employee for Brazilian coffee in El Born
    SELECT e.name, SUM(s.revenue) AS total_sales
    FROM SALES_FACT s
    JOIN EMPLOYEE_DIM e ON s.employee_id = e.employee_id
    JOIN PRODUCT_DIM p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
    JOIN STORE_DIM st ON s.store_id = st.store_id
    WHERE p.origin = 'Brazil' AND st.neighborhood = 'El Born'
    GROUP BY e.name
    ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
    ```
