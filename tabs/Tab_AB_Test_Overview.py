    # A/B Test Analysis: Click-Through Rate on CTA Button

    This repository contains a case study on an A/B test designed to measure the impact of a change on user click behavior. The A/B test involves a control group and an experimental group, with the primary metric being the click-through rate (CTR).

    ---

    ## 📁 Files Overview

    - **`ab_generate_data.py`**: Script to simulate A/B testing data.
    - **`ab_analysis_case_study.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis of the A/B test.
    - **`ab_analysis.py`**: A Python file to initially practice A/B tetsing before moving on to the case study.

    ## 📊 Objective

    To determine whether a new version of a CTA (Call-To-Action) button increases click-through rate compared to the existing version, using both statistical and practical significance.

    ## 🧪 Data Generation (`ab_generate_data.py`)

    - **Control Group (`con`)**: 10,000 users, click probability = 0.2
    - **Experimental Group (`exp`)**: 10,000 users, click probability = 0.6
    - **Total Users**: 20,000
    - **Click Data**: Simulated using a binomial distribution
    - **Additional Columns**:
    - `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user
    - `timestamp`: Simulated using 1-minute intervals

    The data is saved to a CSV file: `ab_test_data.csv`

    ## 📈 Analysis Steps (`ab_analysis_case_study.ipynb`)

    ### 1. 📋 Summary Statistics & Visualization

    - Grouped click data plotted using `seaborn` with yellow (no-click) and black (click) bars
    - Percentage of clicks annotated for each group

    ### 2. 🧮 Statistical Testing

    - **Test Type**: Two-sample Z-test for proportions
    - **Hypotheses**:
    - Null: No difference in click rates between groups
    - Alternative: Significant difference in click rates

    #### Calculated Metrics:
    - Click Probability (CTR):
    - Control group: `p_con_hat`
    - Experimental group: `p_exp_hat`
    - Pooled Probability: `p_pooled_hat`
    - Standard Error: `se`
    - Z-test Statistic: `test_stat`
    - p-value: `p_value`
    - Significance Level (α): 0.05

    #### Results:
    - ✅ **Statistical Significance** was found  
    (p-value < 0.05 and test statistic exceeds critical Z-value)

    ### 3. 🧠 Practical Significance

    - **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: 10%
    - **95% Confidence Interval** for difference in CTR:
    - Calculated as `(p_exp_hat - p_con_hat) ± Z * SE`
    - Example output: CI = (0.04, 0.06)

    #### Decision:
    - ✅ **Practical Significance Achieved**  
    (Lower bound of CI > MDE)

    ---

    ## 📌 Conclusions

    - The new CTA button significantly increased the click-through rate.
    - Both **statistical** and **practical** significance were achieved.
    - The results are **unlikely due to chance**, and the **effect size is meaningful** for business impact.

    ## 💡 Notes

    - Data simulation assumes no bias or systematic error in group assignment or data collection.
    - Analysis is based on the central limit theorem and large sample approximation.
